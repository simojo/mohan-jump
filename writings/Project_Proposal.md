# Project Proposal

As a group, we chose track number 6: Student-designed project. We want to create a game using JavaScript while using as little as HTML as possible. We want to build a game where you start on the left side of the screen to reach a goal on the right. You have one life in this game. The user will be able to move from left to right and they will be able to jump.
